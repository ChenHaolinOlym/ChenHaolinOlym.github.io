    <content type="text"><![CDATA[NetworkOverviewThe History of C++C++ Versions The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization. C++ was initially standardized in 1998 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as C++98, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. C++20 is the next planned standard thereafter, keeping with the current streak of a new version every three years. Compiler vs. Interpreter A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also refereed as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. (C and C++) An interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. (Python and Matlab) IDEIDE (Integrated Development Environment): a source code editor, which sometimes containing, a class browser, an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use in object-oriented software development GUI (Graphical User Interface) construction tools a version control system build automation tools (must at least contain a compiler or an interpreter, or both, sometimes a linker too) a debugger Components in C++ CodeComment multi-line comments /* Comments line 1Comments line 2 Comments line 3 ***/** single-line comments // Comments line 1// Comments line 2// Comments line 3 LibrariesLibraries are collections of previously written tools that perform useful operations. #include &lt;iostream&gt; instructs the compiler to read the relevant definitions from what is called a header (.h) file for you own libraries, write #include “myownlib.h” namespaces: Works like a folder name. It ensures that all the identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified. The standard C++ libraries use a namespace called std, which means that you cannot refer to the names defined in standard header files like iostream.h unless you let the compiler know to which namespace those definitions belong. FunctionA function is a named section of code that performs a specific operation. Every C++ program must contain a function with the name main. Function main is called when the program starts up. When main has finished its work and returns, execution of the program ends. A concise description of other functions, called a function prototype, must appear before the main function. VariablesA variable is a named address for storing a type of value. You must declare a variable before you can use it The declaration establishes the name and type, most cases initial value Most common form of declaration: type name = value; The name and type of a variable are fixed. The value changes whenever you assign a new value to the variable. Name Convention Variable name is case sensitive. The name must start with a letter or the underscore character (_). All other characters in the name must be letters, digits, or the underscore. No spaces or other special characters are permitted in names. Use meaningful words, but must not be one of the reserved keywords. Reserved Keywords Scope local variable global variable instance variable Constants Unlike a variable, which is a placeholder for a value that can be updated as the program runs, the value of a constant does not change during the course of a program. Format of a constant depends on its type: Integral constants consist of a string of digits Floating-point constants include a decimal point The two constants of type boolean are true and false Character and Strings will be discussed later\ declare using const: const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846; Data Types A data type is defined by a domain, which is the set of values that belong to that type, and a set of operations, which defines the behavior of that type. C++ defines a set of primitive types to represent simple data. Four most used: int: represent integers double: represent floating point numbers bool: represent boolean value char: represent single ASCII characters Operators and Operands +: Addition -: Subtraction(binary), Negative of(unary) *: Multiplication /: Division %: Remainder Division and Type CastsIn C++, whenever you apply a binary operator to numeric values, the result will be of type int if both operands are of type int, but will be a double if either operand is a double. So if two int do the division, the computer will throw away the fractional part. Two maintain the fractional part, you need to use the type name as a function call to perform a type cast The Remainder Operator computes the remainder when the first divided by the second applies only to integer operands only make sense when both operands are positive Precedence Precendence rule: Parentheses may be used to change the order of operations. Assignment Statementsvariable = expression; Shorthandvariable op= expression;, op is any of C++’s binary operators. The effect of it is the same as variable = variable op (expression); Incrment and Decrement Operatorx++; ++x; is the same as x += 1; or even x = x + 1;. -- is the same case. Boolean Expression Relational Operators ==: equals &lt;: less than &gt;: greater than !=: not equals &lt;=: less than or equal to &gt;=: greater than or equal to Logical Operators &amp;&amp;: logical AND ||: logical OR !: logical NOT It is not legal in C++ to use more than one relational operator such as $0 \leq x \leq 9$. Short-circuit Evaluation In C++ uses a strategy called short-circuit mode in which it evaluates the right operand only if it needs to do so. So we can use &amp;&amp; and || to prevent execution errors such as “division by zero” error Statements Statements in C++ fall into three basic types: Simple statements: formed by adding a semicolon to the end of a C++ expression. Compound statements (also called blocks) : sequences of statements enclosed in curly braces. Control statements: fall into two categories: Conditional statements that specify some kind of test Iterative statements that specify repetition if Statementif statement has three forms: 123if (condition) &#123; // statements to be executed if the condition is true&#125; 12345if (condition) &#123; // statements to be executed if the condition is true&#125; else &#123; // statements to be executed if the condition is false&#125; 12345678if (condition1) &#123; // statements to be executed if the condition1 is true&#125; else if (condition2) &#123; // statements to be executed if the condition2 is true// . . . more else/if conditions . . .&#125; else &#123; // statements to be executed if all the conditions is false&#125; The ?: OperatorC++ provides a more compact way to express conditional execution. This feature is called the ?: operator (pronounced question-mark-colon). The operator has the following form: condition ? expression1 : expression2 First determines the value of condition. If condition is true, C++ evaluates expression1 and uses that as the value; if condition is false, C++ evaluates expression2 instead. switch StatementThe switch statement provides a convenient syntax for choosing among a set of possible paths: 123456789101112switch ( expression ) &#123; case v1: // statements to be executed if expression = v1 break; case v2: // statements to be executed if expression = v2 break; // . . . more case clauses if needed . . . default: // statements to be executed if no values match break;&#125; while Statement123while ( condition ) &#123; // statements to be repeated&#125; for Statement123for ( init ; test ; step ) &#123; // statements to be repeated&#125; C++ evaluates a for statement by executing the following steps: Evaluate init, which typically declares a control variable. Evaluate test and exit from the loop if the value is false. Execute the statements in the body of the loop. Evaluate step, which usually updates the control variable. Return to step 2 to begin the next loop cycle. FunctionsThe Advantage of Using Functions Functions allow you to shorten a program by allowing you to include the code for a particular operation once and then reuse it as often as you want in a variety of different contexts, typically with different arguments. Functions make programs easier to read by allowing you to invoke an entire sequence of operations using a single name (abstraction) that corresponds to a higher-level understanding of the purpose of the function. Functions simplify program maintenance by allowing you to divide a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces. This process is called decomposition. Top-down design/stepwise refinement Define123type name (parameter list) &#123; // statements in the function body&#125; where type indicates what type the function returns, name is the name of the function, and parameter list is a list of variable declarations used to hold the values of each argument. statements in the function body implement the function (e.g., the algorithm), at least including a return statement: return expression; Functions that return Boolean results are called predicate functions. Functions that return no value at all are called procedure, using void as the result type. All functions need to be declared before they are called by specifying a prototype consisting of the header line followed by a semicolon. Prototype A function prototype is simply the header line of the function followed by a semicolon, which you put in front of the main function so that the compiler knows what arguments the function requires and what type of value it returns, before you actually define the function. If you always define functions before you call them, prototypes are not required. Arguments vs. Parameters A parameter is a placeholder for one of the arguments supplied in the function call and acts in most respects just like a local variable. A parameter is a variable in a function declaration and definition. An argument is an expression used when calling the function. When a function is called, the arguments are the data (actual values) you pass into the function’s parameters. Overload Functions can be overloaded, which means that you can define several different functions with the same name as long as the correct version can be determined by looking at the number and types of the arguments. The pattern of arguments (i.e., the number and types of the arguments but not the parameter names) required for a particular function is called its signature. The primary advantage of using overloading is that doing so makes it easier for you as a programmer to keep track of different function names for the same operation when it is applied in slightly different contexts. The return type cannot be used to differentiate overloaded functions. Optional Functions can specify optional parameters by including an initializer after the variable name. When you use default values for optional parameters, it helps to keep the following rules in mind: The specification of the default value appears only in the function prototype and not in the function definition. Any optional parameters must appear at the end of the parameter list. CallThe Mechanics of Calling a FunctionWhen you invoke a function, the following actions occur: The calling function evaluates the argument expressions in its own context. C++ then copies each argument value into the corresponding parameter variable, which is allocated in a newly assigned region of memory called a stack frame. This assignment follows the order in which the arguments appear: the first argument is copied into the first parameter variable, and so on. C++ then evaluates the statements in the function body, using the new stack frame to look up the values of local variables. When C++ encounters a return statement, it computes the return value and substitutes that value in place of the call. C++ then discards the stack frame for the called function and returns to the caller, continuing from where it left off. Call by ReferenceFunction will only modify the local copy of the arguments. If you want to modify the arguments themselves, use &amp; between type and name. 12345void swap(int &amp; x, int &amp; y) &#123; int tmp = x; x = y; y = tmp;&#125; LibrariesIn computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often to develop software. Libraries can be viewed from two perspectives. Code that uses a library is called a client. The code for the library itself is called the implementation. The point at which the client and the implementation meet is called the interface, which serves as both a barrier and a communication channel: Sharing and reuse Abstraction and hiding C++ Libraries A collection of classes and functions, which are written in the core language and part of the C++ ISO Standard itself. Features of the C++ Standard Library are declared within the std namespace Containers: vector, list, queue, stack, map, set, etc. General: algorithm, functional, iterator, memory, etc. Strings Streams and Input/Output: iostream, fstream, sstream, etc. Localization Language support Thread support library Numerics library C standard library: cmath, cctype, cstring, cstdio, cstdlib, etc. Creating Library Interfaces In C++, libraries are made available to clients through the use of an interface file that has the suffix .h. In C++, the header file contains only the prototypes of the exported functions. The implementations of those functions appear in the corresponding .cpp file. StringsRelationship Between C and C++ One of the fundamental design principles of C++ was that it would contain C as a subset, which is also part of the reason behind the success of C++. This design strategy makes it possible to convert applications from C to C++ incrementally. The downside of this strategy is that the design of C++ is less consistent and integrated than it might otherwise be. Characters C++ use ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) as their encoding for character representation. The data type char therefore fits in a single eight-bit byte. &lt;cctype&gt;(ctype.h)Offer functions to check and modify characters. C String If you put double quotation marks around a sequence of characters, you get what is called a C string (literal), in which the characters are stored in an array of bytes, terminated by a null byte whose ASCII value is 0. Character positions in a C string are identified by an index that begins at 0 and extends up to one less than the length of the string. You cannnot assign a value to a C Sting except for initialization. If you want to assign, use function strcpy strcpy(variable, string); in cstring library. &lt;cstring&gt;(string.h)offers a lot of functions you can use to operate C strings. C++ String12#include &lt;string&gt;// the C++ string library C++ forbids string declaration useing concatenation, such as string str = &quot;hello&quot; + &quot;, &quot; + &quot;world&quot;;Because they will be considered as C String literals. If you want to use +, explicitly convert a string literal to a string object by calling string on the literal string str = string(&quot;hello&quot;) + &quot;, &quot; + &quot;world&quot;; ConcatenationIn C++, you can do concatenation using the &lt;&lt; operator: cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &quot;!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; The + operator doesn’t always work. Operators Methods WarnC++ Strings are mutable. This means clients can change the individual characters in a string. Character SelectingThe &lt;string&gt; library offers two different mechanisms for selecting individual characters from a string: str[index]andstr.at(index). The difference is that at checks to make sure the index is in range. StreamsThe Stream Libraries Insertion OperatorThe insertion operator is &lt;&lt; This operator takes an output stream on the left and an expression of any type on its right. The effect is to write the value of the expression to the output stream using the current format settings. C++ allows you to control the output by including items in the output chain called manipulators (&lt;iomanip&gt;), which affect the way how subsequent values are formatted. Output Manipulators Extraction OperatorThe insertion operator is &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reads formatted data from the stream on the left into the variables that appear on the right.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[NetworkIntroductionBiology is the scientific study of life.Hypothesis: a tentative answer to a question or a proposed explanation for a set of observations. Theory: a comprehensive explanation supported by abundant evidence, and general enough to spin off many new testable hypotheses. Hypothesis-Driven Science Once a hypothesis is formed, an investigator can make predictions about what results are expected if that hypothesis is correct. We then test the hypothesis by performing an experiment to see whether or not the results are as predicted. The Properties of Life Order Regulation Growth and development Energy processing Response to environment Reproduction Evolution Three Domains of LifeSpicies: A species is generally defined as a group of organisms that have the potential to interbreed with one another in nature to produce healthy offspring. Bacteria Archaea Eukarya Bacteria and Archaea have prokaryotic cells. Eukarya have eukaryotic cells. KingdomsThe Domain Eukarya in turn includes three smaller divisions called kingdoms: Kingdom Plantae Kingdom Fungi Kingdom Animalia Most members of the three kingdoms are multicellular. These three multicellular kingdoms are distinguished partly by how the organisms obtain food： Plants produce their own sugars and other foods by photosynthesis. Fungi are mostly decomposers, digesting dead organisms and organic wastes. Animals obtain food by ingesting and digesting other organisms. Those eukaryotes that do not fit into any of the three kingdoms fall into a catch-all group called the protists. Most protists are single-celled; they include microscopic organisms such as amoebas But protists also include certain multicellular forms, such as seaweeds. Scientists are in the process of organizing protists into multiple kingdoms, although they do not yet agree on exactly how to do this. Major Themes in Biology Evolution Structure/Function Information Flow Energy Transformations Interconnection within Systems EvolutionEvolution is the fundamental principle of life and the core theme that unifies all of biology. The theory of evolution by natural selection, first described by Charles Darwin more than 150 years ago, is the one idea that makes sense of everything we know about living organisms. The Darwinian View of LifeThe evolutionary view of life came into focus in 1859 when Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Natural selection is the mechanism for descent with modification. The product of natural selection is adaptation, the accumulation of variations in a population over time. Observing Artifucial SelectionArtificial selection is the purposeful breeding of domesticated plants and animals by humans. Structure/FunctionWithin biological systems, structure (the shape of something) and function (what it does) are often related, with each providing insight into the other. Structure — AnatomyFunction — Physiology Information FlowFor life’s functions to proceed in an orderly manner, information must be stored, transmitted, and used. Energy Transformations Various cellular activities of life are work, such as movement, growth, and reproduction, and work requires energy. Life is made possible by the input of energy, primarily from the sun, and the transformation of energy from one form to another. Interconnection within SystemsHow life is studied at different scales? The study of life extends from the microscopic scale of the molecules and cells that make up organismsto the global scale of the entire living planet. CellsEssential Chemistry of BiologyBasic ChemistryMatters: Elements and Compounds Of the naturally-occurring elements, 25 are essential to humans. Four of these elements make up about 96% of the weight of the body. These four elements are Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen. Much of the remaining 4% is accounted for by 7 elements. Calcium, important for building strong bones and teeth, is found abundantly in dairy products, sardines, and green, leafy vegetables. Phosphorus, a component of DNA, can be obtained by eating eggs, beans, and nuts. Potassium Sulfur Sodium Chlorine Magnesium Trace elements are required in only very small amounts and essential for life. An Iodine deficiency causes goiter. Fluorine is added to dental products and drinking water and helps to maintain healthy bones and teeth. Atoms (Radiation and life) A radioactive isotope is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously. Radiation from decaying isotopes can damage cellular molecules and pose serious health risks. Natural sources of radiation can also pose a threat. Radon, a radioactive gas, is a carcinogen that can cause lung cancer. Radon testing is a standard procedure before a house is bought or sold. Radiativity as tracers: Cells use radioactive isotopes the same way they use nonradioactive isotopes of the same element.Once the cell takes up a radioactive isotope, the location and concentration of the isotope can be detected because of the radiation it emits. This makes radioactive isotopes useful as tracers for monitoring living organisms. A medical diagnostic tool called a PET scan works by detecting small amounts of radiation emitted by radioactive materials that were purposefully introduced into the body. Radioactivity as an Evolutionary Clock: The natural process of radioactive decay can be used to obtain important data about the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Fossils are reliable chronological records of life because we can determine their ages through radiometric dating, which is based on the decay of radioactive isotopes. A living organism assimilates the different isotopes of an element in proportions that reflect their relative abundances in the environment. A fossil’s age can be estimated by measuring the ratio of the two isotopes to learn how many half-life reductions have occurred since it died. Using such techniques, scientists can estimate the ages of fossils from around the world and place them in an ordered sequence called the fossil record. Carbon-14 is present in trace amounts in the environment and is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 5,700 years. Chemical Bonding and MoleculesOnly electrons are directly involved in chemical reactions. Chemical ReactionsSubstrates:the reactants which are consumed during a catalytic or enzymatic reaction. Water and Life Life on Earth began in water and evolved there for 3 billion years before spreading onto land. Modern life is still tied to water. Your cells are composed of 70–95% water. The abundance of water is a major reason that Earth is habitable. Structure/Function: Water The polarity of water molecules and the hydrogen bonding that results explain most of water’s life-supporting properties. We will explore four of those properties: the cohesive nature of water the ability of water to moderate temperature the biological significance of ice floating the versatility of water as a solvent. The Cohesion of Water(?) Water molecules stick together as a result of hydrogen bonding. This tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick together is called cohesion and is much stronger for water than for most other liquids. Trees depend on cohesion to help transport water from their roots to their leaves. Surface tension is a measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid. How Water Moderates Temperature Earth’s giant water supply enables temperatures on the planet to stay within limits that permit life by storing a huge amount of heat from the sun during warm periods giving off heat that warms the air during cold periods. Evaporative cooling occurs when a substance evaporates and the surface of the liquid remaining behind cools down. The Biological Significance of Ice Floating When a deep body of water cools and a layer of ice forms on top, the floating ice acts as an insulating “blanket” over the liquid water, allowing life to persist under the frozen surface. If ice did not float, ponds, lakes, and even the oceans would freeze solid. Water as the Solvent of Life Water can dissolve an enormous variety of solutes necessary for life, providing a medium for chemical reactions. When water dissolves salt ions, each ion becomes surrounded by oppositely charged regions of water molecules. Acids, Bases, and PH Buffers are substances that minimize changes in pH. Buffers accept H+ when they are in excess and donate H+ when they are depleted. When $CO_2$ dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form an acid, whichl owers ocean $pH$ and can greatly change marine environments. The Molecules of LifeCarbon Chemistry Carbon is a versatile molecule. Because carbon can use one or more of its bonds to attach to other carbon atoms, it is possible to construct an endless diversity of carbon skeletons varying in size and branching pattern. One of the simplest organic compounds is methane, $CH_4$, with a single carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Methane is abundant in natural gas and is produced by prokaryotes (原核生物) that live in swamps, and in the digestive tracts of grazing animals, such as cows. Giant Molecules On a molecular scale, many of life’s molecules are gigantic, earning the name macromolecules. Three categories of macromolecules are carbohydrates proteins nucleic acids Digestion breaks down macromolecules to make monomers available to your cells. Large Biological Molecules There are four categories of large biological molecules found in all living creatures: carbohydrates lipids proteins nucleic acids CarbohydratesCarbohydrates include sugars and polymers of sugar. In animals, carbohydrates are a primary source of dietary energy and raw material for manufacturing other kinds of organic compounds. In plants, carbohydrates serve as a building material for much of the plant body. MonosaccharidesSacchar = sugar Examples glucose (sports drinks) fructose (fruit) Monosaccharides, particularly glucose, are the main fuels for cellular work. In water, many monosaccharides form a ring structure. Disaccharides Examples lactose in milk, made from the monosaccharides glucose and galactose, Maltose in beer, malted milk shakes, and malted milk ball candy Sucrose in table sugar. Sucrose is the main carbohydrate in plant sap. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is made by a commercial process that converts natural glucose in corn syrup to much sweeter fructose. HFCS is often one of the first ingredients listed in soft drinks. Common forms: sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup. Sugar is a major cause of tooth decay overconsumption increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Polysaccharides complex carbohydrates made of long chains of sugars-polymers of monosaccharides. Starch is a familiar example of a polysaccharide consists of long strings of glucose monomers is used by plant cells to store energy. Glycogen is used by animal cells to store energy is broken down to release glucose when you need energy. Cellulose is the most abundant organic compound on Earth forms cable-like fibrils in the walls that enclose plant cells cannot be broken by any enzyme produced by animals! Lipids Almost all carbohydrates are hydrophilic molecules that dissolve readily in water. Lipids are hydrophobic, unable to mix with water. Neither huge macromolecules nor polymer Fats A typical fat, or triglyceride, consists of a glycerol molecule joined with three fatty acid molecules via a dehydration reaction. Fats perform essential functions in the human body including energy storage, cushioning, and Insulation. saturated fat If the carbon skeleton of a fatty acid has fewer than the maximum number of hydrogens at the double bond, it is unsaturated, otherwise it is saturated. A saturated fat has all three of its fatty acids saturated. different kinds of fat Most animal fats have a relatively high proportion of saturated fatty acids, can easily stack, tending to be solid at room temperature contribute to atherosclerosis, in which lipid-containing plaques build up along the inside walls of blood vessels. Most plant and fish fats tend to be high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and liquid at room temperature. Hydrogenation adds hydrogen converts unsaturated fats to saturated fats makes liquid fats solid at room temperature creates trans fats, a type of unsaturated fat that is particularly bad for your health. Steroids(?) Steroids are very different from fats in structure and function. The carbon skeleton has four fused rings. Steroids vary in the functional groups attached to this set of rings, and these chemical variations affect their function. Cholesteroal is a key component of cell membranes is the “base steroid” from which your body produces other steroids, such as estrogen and testosterone. Synthetic anabolic steroids are variants of testosterone and mimic some of its effects may be prescribed to treat diseases such as cancer and AIDS are abused by athletes to build up their muscles quickly can cause serious physical and mental problems. Proteins are polymers of amino acid monomers account for more than 50% of the dry weight of most cells are instrumental in almost everything cells do. Major Types of Proteins Structural Proteins (provide support) Storage Proteins (provide amino acids for growth) Contractile Proteins (help movement) Transport Proteins (help transport substances) Enzymes (help chemical reactions) Amino Acids All proteins are made by stringing together a common set of 20 kinds of amino acids. Every amino acid consists of a central carbon atom bonded to four covalent partners. Three of those attachment groups are common to all amino acids: a carboxyl group $(-COOH)$ an amino group $(-NH2)$ a hydrogen atom The variable component of amino acids is called the side chain is attached to the fourth bond of the central carbon. Example Leucine - Hydrophobic side chain Serine - Hydrophilic side chain Protein Shape Cells link amino acids together by dehydration reactions forming peptide bonds creating long chains of amino acids called polypeptides A functional protein is one or more polypeptide chains precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a molecule of unique shape. Four level of protein structure: Primary Structure (is simply the order of amino acids in the peptide chain) Secondary Structure (2-dimensional structures formed due to hydrogen boding between hydrogen of amine group and oxygen of the carbonyl groups) Tertiary Structure (involves the three-dimensional folding of a protein due to interactions of amino acid side chains) Quaternary Structure (involves the association of two or more polypeptides into functional proteins) A slight change in the amino acid sequence can affect a protein’s ability to function. The substitution of one amino acid for another at a particular position in hemoglobin, causes sickle-cell disease. One difference in structure is enough to cause the protein to fold into a different shape, which alters its function, which in turn causes disease. Prions, misfolded versions of normal brain proteins, can cause a lot of disease. A protein’s shape is sensitive to the environment. An unfavorable change in temperature, pH, or some other factor can cause a protein to unravel. Nucleic Acids Nucleic acids are macromolecules that made from monomers called nucleotides Each nucleotide has three parts a five-carbon sugar a phosphate group a nitrogen-containing base. store information provide the instructions for building proteins. consist of two types DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) RNA (ribonucleic acid). DNA The DNA resides in the cell as one or more very long fibers called chromosomes. A gene is a unit of inheritance encoded in a specific stretch of DNA that programs the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. Dehydration reactions link nucleotide monomers into long chains called polynucleotides form covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next form a sugar-phosphate backbone. Each DNA nucleotide has one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A) guanine (G) thymine (T) cytosine (C) A molecule of cellular DNA is double-stranded, with two polynucleotide strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The functional groups hanging off the base determine which bases pair up A only pairs with T G only pairs with C DNA vs. RNA There are many similarities between DNA and RNA Both are polymers of nucleotides Both are made of nucleotides consisting of a sugar a phosphate a base. There are three important differences between DNA and RNA. As its name ribonucleic acid denotes, the RNA sugar is ribose rather than deoxyribose in DNA. Instead of the base thymine, RNA has a similar but distinct base called uracil. RNA is usually found in single-stranded form, whereas DNA usually exists as a double helix. A Tour of the CellThe Microscopic World of CellsCell theory states that all living things are composed of cells and that all cells come from earlier cells. Two Major Categories of Cells Prokaryotic cells include Bacteria Archaea. Eukaryotic cells include protists plants fungi animals Basic Features All cells have several basic features. They are all bounded by a thin plasma membrane. Inside all cells is a thick, jelly-like fluid called the cytosol, in which cellular components are suspended. All cells have one or more chromosomes carrying genes made of DNA. All cells have ribosomes, tiny structures that build proteins according to the instructions from the genes. Prokaryotic Cells Prokaryotic cells are older than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Eukaryotes appeared about 2.1 billion years ago. Prokaryotic cells are usually smaller than eukaryotic cells simpler in structure. A prokaryotic cell lacks a nucleus. Its DNA is coiled into a nucleus-like region called the nucleoid. Surrounding the plasma membrane of most prokaryotic cells is a rigid cell wall, which protects the cell helps maintain its shape Prokaryotes can have short projections called pili, which can also attach to surfaces, and/or flagella, long projections that propel them through their liquid environment. Eukaryotic Cells Eukaryotic cells Only eukaryotic cells have organelles, membrane-enclosed structures that perform specific functions. The most important organelle is the nucleus, which houses most of a eukaryotic cell’s DNA and is surrounded by a double membrane. An Overview of Eukaryotic Cells Eukaryotic cells are fundamentally similar. The region between the nucleus and plasma membrane is the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell consists of various organelles suspended in the liquid cytosol. Organelles Most organelles are found in both animal and plant cells. But there are some important differences. Only plant cells have chloroplasts where photosynthesisoccurs Only animal cells have lysosomes bubbles of digestive enzymes surrounded by membranes An Idealize Animal Cell An Idealize Plant Cell Plasma Membrane The plasma membrane and other membranes of the cell are composed mostly of phospholipids, which group together to form a two-layer sheet called a phospholipid bilayer. Each phospholipid is composed of two distinct regions: a “head” with a negatively charged phosphate group two nonpolar fatty acid “tails.” Suspended in the phospholipid bilayer of most membranes are proteins that help regulate traffic across the membrane perform other functions. The plasma membrane is a fluid mosaic: fluid because molecules can move freely past one another a mosaic because of the diversity of proteins in the membrane Cell Surfaces Plant cells have a cell wall made from cellulose fibers Plant cell walls protect the cells maintain cell shape keep cells from absorbing too much water Animal cells lack cell walls. Fibers made of the protein collagen hold cells together in tissues can have protective and supportive functions In addition, the surfaces of most animal cells contain cell junctions, structures that connect cells together into tissues, allowing the cells to function in a coordinated way. Nucleus The nucleus is the control center of the cell Each gene is a stretch of DNA that stores the information necessary to produce a particular protein. The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. Pores in the envelope allow certain materials to pass between the nucleus and the surrounding cytoplasm. Within the nucleus, long DNA molecules and associated proteins form fibers called chromatin. Each long chromatin fiber constitutes one chromosome. The nucleolus is a prominent structure within the nucleus the site where the components of ribosomes are made Ribosomes Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, the components of ribosomes are made in the nucleus and then transported through the pores of the nuclear envelope into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes begin their work. Although structurally identical, some ribosomes are suspended in the cytosol, making proteins that remain within the fluid of the cell. Others are attached to the outside of the nucleus or an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum, making proteins that are incorporated into membranes or secreted by the cell. How DNA Directs Protein Production? DNA transfers its coded information to a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA exits the nucleus through pores in the nuclear envelope travels to the cytoplasm, where it binds to a ribosome A ribosome moves along the mRNA, translating the genetic message into a protein with a specific amino acid sequence. Endomembrane System The endomembrane system in a cell consists of the nuclear envelope the endoplasmic reticulum the Golgi apparatus lysosomes vacuoles These membranous organelles are physically connected linked by vesicles, sacs made of membrane. The Endoplasmic Reticulum The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one of the main manufacturing facilities in a cell. The ER produces an enormous variety of molecules is connected to the nuclear envelope is composed of interconnected rough and smooth ER that have different structures and functions. Rough ER The “rough” in rough ER refers to ribosomes that stud the outside of its membrane. The ER makes more membrane. Ribosomes attached to the rough ER produce proteins that will be inserted into the growing ER membrane transported to other organelles eventually exported. Some products manufactured by rough ER are chemically modified and then packaged into transport vesicles, sacs made of membrane that bud off from the rough ER. Smooth ER lacks surface ribosomes produces lipids, including steroids helps liver cells detoxify circulating drugs Golgi Apparatus works in partnership with the ER receives, refines, stores, and distributes chemical products of the cell. The Golgi apparatus consists of a stack of membrane plates. Products made in the ER reach the Golgi apparatus in transport vesicles Proteins within a vesicle are usually modified by enzymes during their transit from the receiving to he shipping side of the Golgi apparatus. The shipping side of a Golgi stack is a depot from which finished products can be carried in transport vesicles to other organelles or to the plasma membrane. Lysosomes A lysosome is a membrane-enclosed sac of digestive enzymes found in animal cells Most plant cells do not contain lysosomes Enzymes in a lysosome can break down large molecules such as proteins Polysaccharides fats nucleic acids Lysosomes have several types of digestive functions Many single-celled protists engulf nutrients in tiny cytoplasmic sacs called food vacuoles Lysosomes fuse with the food vacuoles, exposing the food to digestive enzymes Small molecules that result from this digestion, such as amino acids, leave the lysosome and nourish the cell Lysosomes can also destroy harmful bacteria engulf and digest parts of another organelle sculpt tissues during embryonic development, helping to form structures such as fingers. Vacuoles Vacuoles are large sacs made of membrane that bud off from the ER or Golgi apparatus Vacuoles have a variety of functions food vacuoles bud from the plasma membrane certain freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles that pump out excess water that flows into the cell from the outside environment A central vacuole can account for more than half the volume of a mature plant cell The central vacuole of a plant cell is a versatile compartment that may store organic nutrients absorb water contain pigments that attract pollinating insects or poisons that protect against plant-eating animals. Energy Transformations Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own DNA that encodes some of their own proteins made by their own ribosomes. Each chloroplast and mitochondrion contains a single circular DNA chromosome that resembles a prokaryotic chromosome can grow and pinch in two, reproducing themselves. This is evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from ancient free-living prokaryotes that established residence within other, larger host prokaryotes. Chloroplasts Chloroplasts are unique to the photosynthetic cells of plants and algae the organelles that perform photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are divided into compartments by two membranes, one inside the other. The stroma is a thick fluid found inside the innermost membrane. Suspended in that fluid is a network of membrane-enclosed disks and tubes, which form another compartment. The disks occur in interconnected stacks called grana that resemble stacks of poker chips. The grana are a chloroplast’s solar power packs, the structures that trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy. Mitochondria Mitochondria are found in almost all eukaryotic cells are the organelles in which cellular respiration takes place produce ATP from the energy of food molecules An envelope of two membranes encloses the mitochondrion, and the inner membrane encloses a thick fluid called the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane of the envelope has numerous infoldings called cristae. The folded surface of the membrane includes many of the enzymes and other molecules that function in cellular respiration creates a greater area for the chemical reactions of cellular respiration. Cytoskeleton(?) The cytoskeleton is a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm serves as both skeleton and “muscles” for the cell, functioning in support and movement. The cytoskeleton contains several types of fibers made from different proteins. Microtubulesare hollow tubes of protein. The other kinds of cytoskeletal fibers, called intermediate filamentsand microfilaments, are thinner and solid. The cytoskeleton provides anchorage and reinforcement for many organelles in a cell. A cell’s cytoskeleton is dynamic. It can be quickly dismantled in one part of the cell by removing protein subunits and re-formed in a new location by reattaching the subunits. Such rearrangement can provide rigidity in a new location change the shape of the cell cause the whole cell or some of its parts to move. Cilia and Flagella In some eukaryotic cells, microtubules are arranged into structures called flagella and cilia, extensions from a cell that aid in movement. Eukaryotic flagella propel cells through an undulating, whiplike motion. They often occur singly, but may also appear in groups on the outer surface of protists. The Working CellSome Basic Energy ConceptsConservation of Energy Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Potential energy is stored energy, energy that an object has because of its location structure Life depends on countless similar conversions of energy from one form to another. Energy can only be converted from one form to another. EntropySecond Law of Thermodynamics states that the degree of disorder (entropy) is always increasing in the universe. Heat Heat is a type of kinetic energy contained in the random motion of atoms and molecules (energy in its most disordered, chaotic form). All energy conversions generate some heat. Chemical Energy The molecules of food, gasoline, and other fuels have a form of potential energy called chemical energy, which arises from the arrangement of atoms and can be released by a chemical reaction. Cellular respiration is the energy-releasing chemical breakdown of fuel molecules the storage of that energy in a form the cell can use to perform work. Humans convert about 34% (1/3) of our food energy to useful work. The rest of the energy released by the breakdown of fuel molecules generates body heat. Food Calories A calorie (cal) is the amount of energy that can raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water by 1°C. Food Calories are kilocalories (Cal), equal to 1,000 calories. ATP and Cellular Work Chemical energy released by the breakdown of organic molecules during cellular respiration is used to generate molecules of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP acts like an energy shuttle. Store energy and release it later as needed Structure of ATP ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consists of an organic molecule called adenosine plus a tail of three phosphate groups is broken down to ADP, adenosine diphosphate, and a phosphate group, releasing energy. The release of the phosphate at the tip of the triphosphate tail makes energy available to cells. Phosphate Transfer ATP energizes other molecules in cells by transferring phosphate groups to those molecules. This energy helps cells change shape enables the transport of ions and other dissolved substances across the membranes drives the production of a cell’s large molecules. The ATP Cycle Cells spend ATP continuously. Cellular work spends ATP, which is recycled when ADP and phosphate are combined, using energy released by cellular respiration. Up to 10 million ATPs are consumed and recycled each second in a working muscle cell. Enzymes Metabolism is the total of all chemical reactions in an organism. Most metabolic reactions require the assistance of enzymes, proteins that speed up chemical reactions without being consumed by the reaction. All living cells contain thousands of different enzymes, each promoting a different chemical reaction. Activation EnergyActivation energy is the energy that must be invested to start a reaction Enzyme Activity An enzyme is very selective in the reaction it catalyzes. Each enzyme recognizes a substrate, a certain reactant molecule. The active site has a shape and chemistry that fits the substrate molecule. This interaction is called induced fit because the entry of the substrate induces the enzyme to change shape slightly, making the fit between the substrate and active site snugger. After the products are released from the active site, the enzyme can accept another molecule of its substrate. The ability to function repeatedly is a key characteristic of enzymes. Many enzymes are named for their substrates, but with an –ase ending. Enzyme Inhibitors Certain molecules inhibit a metabolic reaction by binding to an enzyme disrupting its function. Some of these enzyme inhibitors are actually substrate imposters that plug up the active site. Other inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site remote from the active site, but the binding changes the enzyme’s shape so that the active site no longer accepts the substrate. In each case, an inhibitor disrupts the function of an enzyme by altering its shape. In some cases, the binding of an inhibitor is reversible. If a cell is producing more of a certain product than it needs, that product may reversibly inhibit an enzyme required for its production, keeping the cell from wasting resources that could be put to better use. (Feedback inhibition) Many beneficial drugs work by inhibiting enzymes. Penicillin blocks the active site of an enzyme that bacteria use in making cell walls. Ibuprofen inhibits an enzyme involved in sending pain signals. Many cancer drugs inhibit enzymes that promote cell division. Many toxins and poisonsalso work as inhibitors. Membrane FunctionOf all the major functions of these membrane proteins, one of the most important is the regulation of transport in and out of the cell. Passive Transport Passive transport is the diffusion of a substance across a membrane without the input of energy. Molecules constantly vibrate and wander randomly. Diffusion is the movement of molecules spreading out evenly into the available space. In passive transport, a substance diffuses down its concentration gradient from where the substance is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. Substances that do not cross membranes spontaneously, or otherwise cross very slowly, can be transported via proteins that act as corridors for specific molecules. This assisted transport is called facilitated diffusion, a type of passive transport because it does not require the cell to expend energy. Osmosis and Water Balance The diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane is osmosis. The survival of a cell depends on its ability to balance water uptake and loss. The control of water balance is called osmoregulation. For an animal to survive a hypotonic or hypertonic environment, the animal must have a way to balance the uptake and loss of water. Plant cells are healthiest in a hypotonic environment with a net inflow of water, which expands their cell walls without bursting. As a plant cell loses water it shrivels its plasma membrane may pull away from the cell wall, which usually kills the cell. Active Transport Active transport requires that a cell expend energy to move molecules across a membrane. Cellular energy (usually provided by ATP) is used to drive a transport protein that pumps a solute against the concentration gradient. Active transport allows cells to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from environmental concentrations. Exocytosis and Endocytosis: Traffic of Large Molecules Exocytosis is the movement of materials out of the cytoplasm of a cell via membranous vesicles or vacuoles that fuse with the plasma membrane. In endocytosis, a cell takes material in via vesicles that bud inward. Cellular Respiration: Obtaining Energy from FoodEnergy Flow and Chemical Cycling in the Biosphere All life requires energy In almost all ecosystems on Earth, this energy originates with the sun. During photosynthesis, plants convert the energy of sunlight to the chemical energy of sugars and other organic molecules. Humans and other animals depend on this conversion for food and more. Producers and Consumers Plants and other autotrophs (“self-feeders”) are organisms that make all their own organic matter, including carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, from nutrients that are entirely inorganic: carbon dioxide from the air and water minerals from the soil. Heterotrophs (other-feeders) include humans and other animals cannot make organic molecules from inorganic ones. Most ecosystems depend entirely on photosynthesis for food. Biologists refer to plants and other autotrophs as producers heterotrophs, in contrast, as consumers, because they obtain their food by eating plants or by eating animals that have eaten plants. Chemical Cycling between Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration The chemical ingredients for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and water ($H_2O$). $CO_2$ passes from the air into a plant via tiny pores. $H_2O$ is absorbed from the soil by the plant’s roots. In leaf cells, chloroplast use light energy to rearrange these ingrediant to produce sugars, most importantly glucose($C_6H_{12}O_6$). A by-product is oxygen gas($O_2$) A chemical process called cellular respiration harvests energy that is stored in sugars and other organic molecules. The process happens in both animal and plant cells. Cellular respiration uses $O_2$ to help convert the energy stored in the chemical bonds of organic fuels to ATP. In plants and animals, the production of ATP occurs mainly in mitochondria. The waste products of cellular respiration are $CO_2$ and $H_2O$, the very same ingredients used for photosynthesis. Plants usually make more organic molecules than they need for fuel. Cellular Respiration Cellular respiration is aerobic harvesting of chemical energy from organic fuel molecules the main way that chemical energy is harvested from food and converted to ATP It requires that a cell exchange two gases with its surroundings. The cell takes in oxygen in the form of the gas $O_2$. It gets rid of waste in the form of the gas carbon dioxide, or $CO_2$. Cellular respiration consists of many chemical steps, with more than two dozen reactions in all involves a specific enzyme to catalyze each reaction constitutes one of the most important metabolic pathways for nearly every eukaryotic cell provides the energy these cells need to maintain the functions of life. The many chemical steps can be grouped into three main stages: glycolysis the citric acid cycle electron transport $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \longrightarrow 6CO_2+6H_2O + \approx\text{32ATP}$ Three Stages of Cellular RespirationOverview During glycolysis, a molecule of glucose is split into two molecules of a compound called pyruvic acid, usually located in the cytoplasm. The citric acid cycle (also called the Krebs cycle)uses enzymes that are dissolved in the fluid within mitochondria andcompletes the breakdown of glucose all the way to CO2, which is then released as a waste product. Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle generate a small amount of ATP directly and much more ATP indirectly, via reactions that transfer electrons from fuel molecules to a molecule called $NAD^+$ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).The electron transfer forms a molecule called NADH, which acts as a shuttle carrying high-energy electrons from one area of the cell to another. The third stage of cellular respiration is electron transport. Electrons captured from food by NADH are stripped of their energy, a little bit at a time, until they are finally combined with oxygen to form water. The proteins and other molecules that make up electron transport chains are embedded within the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Electron transport from NADH to oxygen releases the energy your cells use to make most of their ATP. The process can produce around 32 ATP molecules for each glucose molecule consumed. Glycolysis During glycolysis A six-carbon glucose molecule is split in half to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. The three-carbon molecules then donate high-energy electrons to $NAD^+$ forming NADH generate two ATP molecules directly when enzymes transfer phosphate groups from fuel molecules to ADP. The Citric Cycle(?) The pyruvic acid must be converted to a form the citric acid cycle can use. Each pyruvic acid loses a carbon as CO2.The remaining fuel molecules, with only two carbons left, are called acetic acid. Electrons are stripped from these molecules and transferred to another molecule of $NAD^+$, forming more NADH. Finally, each acetic acid is attached to a molecule called coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl CoA. The CoA escorts the acetic acid into the first reaction of the citric acid cycle and is then stripped and recycled. The citric acid cycle finishes extracting the energy of sugar by dismantling the acetic acid molecules all the way down to $CO_2$. Acetic acid joins a four-carbon acceptor molecule to form a six-carbon product called citric acid (for which the cycle is named). For every acetic acid molecule that enters the cycle as fuel, two $CO_2$ molecules eventually exit as a waste product. Along the way, the citric acid cycle harvests energy from the fuel. Some of the energy is used to produce ATP directly. However, the cycle captures much more energy in the form of $NADH$ and a closely related electron carrier called $FADH_2$. All the carbon atoms that entered the cycle as fuel are accounted for as $CO_2$ exhaust, and the four-carbon acceptor molecule is recycled. The Cytric Cycle will generate two ATP by direct synthesis, just as Glycolysis Electron Transport(?) The transfer of electrons from organic fuel (food) to NAD+ converts it to NADH. $NADH + \frac{1}{2}O_2 + 2H^+ = NAD^+ H_2O$ two electrons are transfer during the process. About 28 ATP is generated for each glucose by ATP synthase The overall effect of all this transfer of electrons during cellular respiration is a “downward” trip for electrons from glucose to NADH to an electron transport chain to oxygen. The molecules of electron transport chains are built into the inner membranes of mitochondria. The energy stored by electron transport behaves something like the water behind a dam. There is a tendency for hydrogen ions to gush back to where they are less concentrated, just as there is a tendency for water to flow downhill. The inner membrane temporarily “dams” hydrogen ions. Fermentation Some of the cells can actually work for short periods without oxygen. Fermentation is the anaerobic harvest of food energy. After functioning anaerobically for about 15 seconds, muscle cells begin to generate ATP by the process of fermentation. Fermentation in Microorganisms Fermentation alone is enough to sustain many microorganisms. The lactic acid produced by yeast using lactic acid fermentation is used to produce cheese, sour cream, and yogurt soy sauce, pickles, cabbage, and olives sausage meat products. Yeast is capable of cellular respiration and fermentation can perform alcoholic fermentation to produce $CO_2$ and ethyl alcohol instead of lactic acid. Photosynthesis: Using Light to Make FoodThe Basics of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is used by plants, algae(protists), and certain bacteria transforms light energy into chemical energy uses carbon dioxide and water as starting materials releases oxygen gas as a by-product. Organisms that generate their own organic matter from inorganic ingredients are called autotrophs. Plants and other organisms that do this by photosynthesis—photo-autotrophs—are the producers for most ecosystems. Chloroplsts Chloroplasts are light-absorbing organelles the site of photosynthesis found mostly in the interior cells of leaves Stomata are tiny pores in leaves where carbon dioxide enters and oxygen exits. Membranes within the chloroplast form the framework where many of the reactions of photosynthesis occur. Like a mitochondrion, a chloroplast has a double-membrane envelope. The inner membrane encloses a compartment filled with stroma, a thick fluid. Suspended in the stroma are interconnected membranous sacs called thylakoids. The thylakoids are concentrated in stacks called grana (singular, granum). The chlorophyll molecules that capture light energy are built into the thylakoid membranes. Overview Photosynthesis is a chemical transformation that requires a lot of energy, and sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll provides that energy. Recall that cellular respiration is a process of electron transfer. A “fall” of electrons from food molecules to oxygen to form water releases the energy that mitochondria can use to make ATP. The opposite occurs in photosynthesis: Electrons are added to carbon dioxide to produce sugar. $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \xrightarrow [\text{Photosynthesis}] {\text{Light energy}} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$ Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the light reactions chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes absorbs solar energy, which is then converted to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH water is split, providing a source of electrons and giving off O2 gas as a by-product. The Calvin cycle uses the products of the light reactions to make sugar from carbon dioxide. ATP generated by the light reactions provides the energy for sugar synthesis. The NADPH produced by the light reactions provides the high-energy electrons that drive the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide. The initial incorporation of carbon from the atmosphere into organic compounds is called carbon fixation. chloroplasts absorb light mainly in the blue-violet and red-orange part of the spectrum and those wavelengths of light are the ones mainly responsible for photosynthesis. Light ReactionsChloroplast Pigments Chloroplasts contain several different pigments that absorb light of different wavelengths. Chlorophyll a participates directly in the light reactions absorbs mainly blue-violet and red light. Chlorophyll b is very similar to chlorophyll a absorbs mainly blue and orange light conveys absorbed energy to chlorophyll a Carotenoids absorb mainly blue-green light absorb and dissipate excessive light energy that might damage chlorophyll Photosystems(?) In the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll molecules are organized with other molecules into photosystems. Each photosystem has a cluster of a few hundred pigment molecules, including chlorophylls a and b, and some carotenoids. This cluster of pigment molecules functions as a light-gathering antenna. When a photon strikes one of the pigment molecules, the energy jumps from molecule to molecule until it arrives at the reaction center of the photosystem. The reaction center consists of chlorophyll a molecules that sit next to a primary electron acceptor, which traps the light-excited electron from the chlorophyll a in the reaction center. Another team of molecules built into the thylakoid membrane then uses that trapped energy to make ATP and NADPH. Two photosystems cooperate in the light reactions: Photons excite electrons in the chlorophyll of the first photosystem These photons are then trapped by the primary electron acceptor. This photosystem then replaces the lost electrons by extracting new ones from water. This is the step that releases $O_2$ during photosynthesis. Energized electrons from the first photosystem pass down an electron transport chain to the second photosystem. The chloroplast uses the energy released by this electron “fall” to make ATP. The second photosystem transfers its light-excited electrons to NADP+, reducing it to NADPH. The two photosystems and the electron transport chain that connects them transfer electrons from $H_2O$ to $NADP^+$, producing NADPH. The Calvin Cycle(?) The Calvin cycle functions like a sugar factory within a chloroplast regenerates the starting material with each turn. With each turn of the cycle, there are chemical inputs and outputs. The inputs are $CO_2$ from the air ATP and NADPH produced by the light reactions. The Calvin cycle constructs an energy-rich sugar molecule called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)using carbon from $CO_2$ energy from ATP high-energy electrons from NADPH The plant cell can then use G3P as the raw material to make glucose other organic compounds. GeneticsCellular Reproduction: Cells from Cells Reproduction may result in the birth of new organisms more commonly involves the production of new cells. When a cell undergoes reproduction, or cell division, two “daughter” cells are produced that are genetically identical to each other the “parent” cell. Before a parent cell splits into two, it duplicates its chromosomes, the structures that contain most of the cell’s DNA. During cell division, each daughter cell receives one identical set of chromosomes from the lone, original parent cell. Cell division plays several important roles in the lives of organisms. Cell division replaces damaged or lost cells permits growth allows for reproduction In asexual reproduction, single-celled organisms reproduce by dividing in half there is no fertilization of an egg by a sperm. Sexual reproductionrequires fertilization of an egg by a sperm. The production of gametes— egg and sperm — involves a special type of cell division called meiosis, which occurs only in reproductive organs. Mitosis is the type of cell division responsible for asexual reproduction growth and maintenance of multicellular organisms In summary, two kinds of cell division are involved in the lives of sexually reproducing organisms: mitosis for growth and maintenance meiosis for reproduction. Eukaryotic Chromosomes Chromosomes are made of chromatin, fibers composed of roughly equal amounts of DNA and protein molecules, which help organize the chromatin control the activity of its genes. Each eukaryotic chromosome contains one very long DNA molecule, typically bearing thousands of genes. The number of chromosomes in a eukaryotic cell depends on the species. The DNA in a cell is packed into an elaborate, multilevel system of coiling and folding. Histones are proteins used to package DNA in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of DNA wound around histone molecules. Duplicating Chromosomes Before a cell begins the division process, the DNA molecule of each chromosome is copied through the process of DNA replication and new histone protein molecules attach as needed. The result is that each chromosome consists of two copies called sister chromatids, which contain identical genes. Two sister chromatids are joined together tightly at a narrow “waist” called the centromere. When the cell divides, the sister chromatids of a duplicated chromosome separate from each other. Once separated from its sister, each chromatid is considered a full-fledged chromosome is identical to the original chromosome. Cell Cycle A cell cycle is the ordered sequence of events that extend from the time a cell is first formed from a dividing parent cell to its own division into two cells. Think of the cell cycle as the “lifetime” of a cell, from its “birth” to its own reproduction. Interphase Most of the cell cycle is spent in interphase, which lasts for at least 90% of the cell cycle. During interphase, a cell performs its normal functions, doubles everything in its cytoplasm grows in size. From the standpoint of cell reproduction, the most important event of interphase is chromosome duplication, when the DNA in the nucleus is precisely doubled. The period when this occurs is called the S phase (for DNA synthesis). The interphase periods before and after the S phase are called the $G_1$ and $G_2$ phases, respectively (G stands for gap). During $G_1$, each chromosome is single, and the cell performs its normal functions. During $G_2$ (after DNA duplication during the S phase), each chromosome in the cell consists of two identical sister chromatids, and the cell prepares to divide. mitotic phase(?) The mitotic (M) phase includes two overlapping processes: mitosis, in which the nucleus and its contents divide evenly into two daughter nuclei cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm (along with all the organelles) is divided in two. The combination of mitosis and cytokinesis produces two genetically identical daughter cells. Mitosis Mitosis consists of four distinct phases: Prophase Metaphase Anaphase Telophase The chromosomes and their movements depend on the mitotic spindle, a football-shaped structure of microtubules that guides the separation of the two sets of daughter chromosomes. Cytokinesis Cytokinesis usually begins during telophase divides the cytoplasm is different in plant and animal cells. In animal cells, cytokinesis is known as cleavage begins with the appearance of a cleavage furrow, an indentation at the equator of the cell. In plant cells, cytokinesis begins when vesicles containing cell wall material collect at the middle of the cell and then fuse, forming a membranous disk called the cell plate. The cell plate grows outward, accumulating more cell wall material as more vesicles join it. Eventually, the membrane of the cell plate fuses with the plasma membrane, and the cell plate’s contents join the parental cell wall. Cancer Cancer cells do not respond normally to the cell cycle control system divide excessively may invade other tissues of the body. Cancer cells can form tumors, abnormally growing masses of body cells. If the abnormal cells remain at the original site, the lump is called a benign tumor. Malignant tumors can spread into neighboring tissues and other parts of the body, forming new tumors, and can interrupt organ function. A malignant tumor is commonly-called cancer. The spread of cancer cells beyond their original site is called metastasis. There are three main types of cancer treatment. Surgery to remove a tumor is usually the first step. In radiation therapy, parts of the body that have cancerous tumors are exposed to concentrated beams of high-energy radiation, which often harm cancer cells more than normal cells. Radiation therapy is often effective against malignant tumors that have not yet spread. Chemotherapy, the use of drugs to disrupt cell division, is used to treat widespread or metastatic tumors. Although cancer can strike anyone, there are certain lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your chances of developing cancer or increase your chances of surviving it. These include not smoking exercising adequately avoiding exposure to the sun eating a high-fiber, low-fat diet performing self-exams regularly visiting a doctor to identify tumors early. Meiosis Sexual reproduction produces offspring that contain a unique combination of genes from the parents depends on the cellular processes of meiosis and fertilization. Homologous Chromosomes Homologous chromosomes resemble each other in length and centromere position carry genes controlling the same inherited characteristics. Humans have 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of matching chromosomes, called autosomes two different sex chromosomes, X and Y, which determine a person’s sex (male or female). Gametes and the Life Cycle of a Sexual Organism Humans are said to be diploid organisms because all body cells contain pairs of homologous chromosomes. A haploid cell has only one member of each pair of homologous chromosomes. The Process of Meiosis Meiosis, the process of cell division that produces haploid gametes in diploid organisms, resembles mitosis, but with two differences. The first difference is that the number of chromosomes during meiosis is cut in half. an exchange of genetic material—pieces of chromosomes—between homologous chromosomes. This exchange, called crossing over, occurs during the first prophase of meiosis. Corssing Over Crossing over is the exchange of corresponding segments between nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, which occurs during prophase I of meiosis. With crossing over, gametes arise with chromosomes that are partly from the mother and partly from the father. When Meiosis Goes Awry In nondisjunction, the members of a chromosome pair fail to separate at anaphase, producing gametes with abnormal numbers of chromosomes. Nondisjunction can occur during meiosis I or II. In a condition called trisomy 21, there are three number 21 chromosomes, making 47 chromosomes in total. A person with trisomy 21 has a condition called Down syndrome, which affects about 1 out of every 700 children The Advantages of Sex Many species can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction eliminates the need to expend energy forming gametes and copulating with a partner confers an evolutionary advantage when organisms are sparsely distributed or superbly suited to a stable environment. Sexual reproduction may convey an evolutionary advantage by producing offspring of varied genetic makeup or reducing the incidence of harmful genes more rapidly. Patterns of InheritanceGenetics and Heredity Heredity is the transmission of traits from one generation to the next. Genetics is the scientific study of heredity. Gregor Mendel worked in the 1860s and argued that parents pass on to their offspring discrete genes (which he termed “heritable factors”), genes are responsible for inherited traits genes retain their individual identities generation after generation, no matter how they are mixed up or temporarily masked. Mendel’s Experiment Mendel probably chose to study garden peas because they were easy to grow came in many readily distinguishable varieties. A character is a heritable feature that varies among individuals. A trait is a variant of a character. Each of the characters Mendel studied occurred in two distinct traits. Perhaps the most important advantage of pea plants as an experimental model was that Mendel could strictly control their reproduction. The petals of a pea flower almost completely enclose the egg-producing organ (the carpel) and the sperm-producing organs (the stamens). Consequently, pea plants usually self-fertilize because sperm-carrying pollen grains released from the stamens land on the tip of the egg-containing carpel of the same flower. Mendel created purebred varieties of plants crossed two different purebred varieties. Hybridsare the offspring of two different purebred varieties. The cross-fertilization itself is referred to as a genetic cross. The parental plants are the P generation. Their hybrid offspring are the $F_1$ generation. A cross of the $F_1$ plants forms the $F_2$ generation. The seven characters of pea plants studied by Mendel Mendel’s Law of Segregation This law is for Monohybrid Crosses From these results and others, Mendel developed four hypotheses: here are alternative versions of genes that account for variations in inherited characters. The alternative versions of genes are called alleles.、 For each inherited character, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. An organism that has two identical alleles for a gene is said to be homozygous for that gene. An organism that has two different alleles for a gene is said to be heterozygous for that gene. If the two alleles of an inherited pair differ, then one determines the organism’s appearance and is called the dominant allele, and the other has no noticeable effect on the organism’s appearance and is called the recessive allele. A sperm or egg carries only one allele for each inherited character because the two alleles for a character segregate (separate) from each other during the production of gametes. This statement is called the law of segregation. When sperm and egg unite at fertilization, each contributes its alleles, restoring the paired condition in the offspring. Genetic Alleles and Homologous Chromosomes A gene locus is a specific location of a gene along a chromosome. Alleles (alternative versions) of a gene reside at the same locus on homologous chromosomes. However, the two chromosomes may bear either identical alleles or different ones at any one locus. Mendel’s Law of Independent AssortmentThis law is for Dihybrid Crosses A dihybrid cross is the mating of parental varieties differing in two characters. If the genes for the two characters were inherited together, then the $F_1$ hybrids would produce only the same two kinds of gametes that they received from their parents the $F_2$ generation would show a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. If, however, the two seed characters sorted independently, then the $F_1$ generation would produce four gamete genotypes (RY, rY, Ry, and ry) in equal quantities the $F_2$ generation would have nine different genotypes producing four different phenotypes in a ratio of 9:3:3:1. Mendel’s dihybrid cross supported the hypothesis that each pair of alleles segregates independently of the other pairs during gamete formation. Thus, the inheritance of one character has no effect on the inheritance of another. This is called Mendel’s law of independent assortment. TestcrossA testcross is a mating between an individual of dominant phenotype (but unknown genotype) and a homozygous recessive individual. Use of Mendel’s LawsFamily Pedigrees A trait that is dominant does not imply that it is either normal or more common than a recessive phenotype. Wild-type traits (those seen most often in nature) are not necessarily specified by dominant alleles. Human Disorders Controlled by a Single GeneRecessive DisordersDominant DisordersGenetic Testing Today many tests can detect the presence of disease-causing alleles. Most genetic tests are performed during pregnancy if the prospective parents are aware that they have an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic disease. In amniocentesis, a physician uses a needle to extract about 2 teaspoons of the fluid that bathes the developing fetus. In chorionic villus sampling, a physician inserts a narrow, flexible tube through the mother’s vagina and into her uterus, removing some placental tissue. Variations on Mendel’s LawsIncomplete DominanceIn incomplete dominance, $F_1$ hybrids have an appearance between the phenotypes of the two parents. Polygenic InheritanceEpigenetics Many phenotypic characters result from a combination of heredity and environment. Whether human characters are more influenced by genes or by the environment—nature or nurture—is a very old and hotly contested issue. Spending time with identical twins will convince anyone that environment, and not just genes, affects a person’s traits. The Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance The chromosome theory of inheritance states that genes are located at specific positions (loci) on chromosomes and the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and fertilization accounts for inheritance patterns. It is chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment during meiosis account for Mendel’s laws. Linked Genes Linked genes are located near each other on the same chromosome tend to travel together during meiosis and fertilization. Such genes are often inherited as a set and therefore often do not follow Mendel’s law of independent assortment. Sex-Linked Genes A gene located on a sex chromosome is called a sex-linked gene. Most sex-linked genes are found on the X chromosome. A number of human conditions, including red-green colorblindness, hemophilia, and a type of muscular dystrophy, result from sex-linked recessive alleles. The Structure and Function of DNADNA: Structure and ReplicationDNA and RNA Structure DNA and RNA are nucleic acids. They consist of long chains (polymers) of chemical units (monomers) called nucleotides. A nucleotide polymer is a polynucleotide. Polynucleotides can be very long and may have any sequence of the four different types of nucleotides. Nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next in a repeating pattern of sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate, which is known as a sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases are arranged like ribs that project from this backbone. You can think of a polynucleotide as a long ladder split in half longwise, with rungs that come in four colors. The sugars and phosphates make up the side of the ladder, with the sugars acting as the half-rungs. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogenous base a sugar a phosphate group. The four nucleotides found in DNA differ in their nitrogenous bases. The bases can be divided into two types. Thymine (T)and cytosine (C) are single-ring structures (Pyrimidines). Adenine (A)and guanine (G) are larger, double-ring structures (Purines). the Double Helix The model of DNA is like a full ladder twisted into a spiral. The sides represent the sugar-phosphate backbones. Each rung represents a pair of bases connected by hydrogen bonds. The base-pairing rules dictate the side-by-side combinations of bases that form the rungs of the double helix. DNA Replication DNA polymerases are enzymes that make the covalent bonds between the nucleotides of a new DNA strand can help repair DNA that has been damaged by toxic chemicals or high-energy radiation, such as X-rays and ultraviolet light. DNA replication begins on a double helix at specific sites, called origins of replication proceeds in both directions, creating what are called replication “bubbles”. ensures that all the body cells in a multicellular organism carry the same genetic information is also the means by which genetic information is passed along to offspring. The Genetic Code The genetic code is the set of rules that convert a nucleotide sequence in RNA to an amino acid sequence. Of the 64 triplets 61 code for amino acids 3 are stop codons, instructing the ribosomes to end the polypeptide. The genetic code is nearly universal, shared by organisms from the simplest bacteria to the most complex plants and animals. Transcription: From DNA to RNA Transcription is the transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA. As with DNA replication, two DNA strands must first separate at the place where the process will start. In transcription, however, only one of the DNA strands serves as a template for the newly forming RNA molecule; the other strand is unused. The nucleotides that make up the new RNA molecule take their place one at a time along the DNA template strand by forming hydrogen bonds with the nucleotide bases there. The RNA nucleotides are linked by the transcription enzyme RNA polymerase. Initialization The “start transcribing” signal is a nucleotide sequence called a promoter, which is located in the DNA at the beginning of the gene a specific place where RNA polymerase attaches. The first phase of transcription, called initiation, is the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter the start of RNA synthesis. RNA Elongation During the second phase of transcription, called elongation, the RNA grows longer the RNA strand peels away from its DNA template, allowing the two separated DNA strands to come back together in the region already transcribed. Termination During the third phase of transcription, called termination RNA polymerase reaches a special sequence of bases in the DNA template called a terminator, signaling the end of the gene polymerase detaches from the RNA and the gene the DNA strands rejoin. Processing of RNA In the cells of prokaryotes, which lack nuclei, the RNA transcribed from a gene immediately functions as messenger RNA (mRNA), the molecule that is translated into protein. The eukaryotic cell localizes transcription in the nucleus modifies, or processes, the RNA transcripts in the nucleus before they move to the cytoplasm for translation by ribosomes. One kind of RNA processing is the addition of extra nucleotides to the ends of the RNA transcript. These additions, called the cap and tail, protect the RNA from attack by cellular enzymes and help ribosomes recognize the RNA as mRNA. Another type of RNA processing is made necessary in eukaryotes by noncoding stretches of nucleotides that interrupt the nucleotides that actually code for amino acids. Most genes of plants and animals include such internal noncoding regions, which are called introns. The coding regions—the parts of a gene that are expressed—are called exons. Both exons and introns are transcribed from DNA into RNA. However, before the RNA leaves the nucleus, the introns are removed the exons are joined to produce an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence. This process is called RNA splicing. RNA splicing is believed to play a significant role in humans in allowing our approximately 21,000 genes to produce many thousands more polypeptides and by varying the exons that are included in the final mRNA. Translation: The PlayersTransfer RNA (tRNA) A cell uses a molecular interpreter, a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA), to match amino acids to the appropriate codons to form the new polypeptide. To perform this task, tRNA molecules must carry out two distinct functions: pick up the appropriate amino acids recognize the appropriate codons in the mRNA. The unique structure of tRNA molecules enables them to perform both tasks. At one end of the tRNA is a special triplet of bases called an anticodon. The anticodon triplet is complementary to a codon triplet on mRNA. During translation, the anticodon on the tRNA recognizes a particular codon on the mRNA by using base-pairing rules. At the other end of the tRNA molecule is a site where one specific kind of amino acid attaches. Although all tRNA molecules are similar, there are slightly different versions of tRNA for each amino acid. Ribosomes Ribosomes are the organelles in the cytoplasm that coordinate the functioning of mRNA and tRNA actually make polypeptides. A ribosome consists of two subunits. Each subunit is made up of proteins a considerable amount of another kind of RNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA). A fully assembled ribosome has a binding site for mRNA on its small subunit binding sites for tRNA on its large subunit. Process Translation is divided into the same three phases as transcription: initiation elongation termination. Initiation Initiation brings together mRNA the first amino acid with its attached tRNA two subunits of the ribosome. The mRNA molecule has a cap and tail that help the mRNA bind to the ribosome. Initiation occurs in two steps. An mRNA molecule binds to a small ribosomal subunit, then a special initiator tRNA binds to the start codon, where translation is to begin on the mRNA. A large ribosomal subunit binds to the small one, creating a functional ribosome. Elongation(?) Once initiation is complete, amino acids are added one by one to the first amino acid. Each addition occurs in the three-step elongation process. Step 1: Codon recognition. The anticodon of an incoming tRNA molecule, carrying its amino acid, pairs with the mRNA codon in the A site of the ribosome. Step 2: Peptide bond formation. The polypeptide leaves the tRNA in the P site and attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA in the A site. The ribosome creates a new peptide bond. Now the chain has one more amino acid. Step 3: Translocation. The P site tRNA now leaves the ribosome, and the ribosome moves the remaining tRNA, carrying the growing polypeptide, to the P site. The mRNA and tRNA move as a unit. This movement brings into the A site the next mRNA codon to be translated, and the process can start again with step 1. Termination Elongation continues until a stop codon reaches the ribosome’s A site the completed polypeptide is freed the ribosome splits back into its subunits. Recent Discovery For decades, the DNA $\rightarrow$ RNA $\rightarrow$ protein pathway was believed to be the sole means by which genetic information controls traits. In recent years, however, this notion has been challenged by discoveries that point to more complex roles for RNA. MutationsTypes of Mutations Mutations within a gene can be divided into two general categories: nucleotide substitutions nucleotide deletions or insertions. Missense mutations involve a single nucleotide and change the amino acid coding. Nonsense mutations change an amino acid codon into a stop codon. Mutations involving the deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides in a gene, called frameshift mutations, often have disastrous effects. Adding or subtracting nucleotides may alter the triplet grouping of the genetic message. A frameshift mutation most often produces a non-functioning polypeptide. Mutagens Mutations can occur in a number of ways. Spontaneous mutationsresult from random errors during DNA replication or recombination. Other sources of mutation are physical and chemical agents called mutagens. The most common physical mutagen is high-energy radiation, such as X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) light. Chemical mutagens are of various types. Because many mutagens can act as carcinogens, agents that cause cancer, you should avoid them as much as possible. Viruses and Other Noncellular Infectious Agents(?)Virus A viruses share some of the characteristics of living organisms, such as having genetic material in the form of nucleic acid packaged within a highly organized structure. virus is generally not considered alive because it is not cellular cannot reproduce on its own. Bacteriophages Viruses that attack bacteria are called bacteriophages (“bacteria-eaters”), or phages for short. The phage consists of a molecule of DNA enclosed within an elaborate structure made of proteins. Plant Viruses Viruses that infect plant cells can stunt plant growth diminish crop yields. Most known plant viruses have RNA rather than DNA as their genetic material. Many of them, like the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), are rod-shaped with a spiral arrangement of proteins surrounding the nucleic acid. TMV, which infects tobacco and related plants, causing discolored spots on the leaves, was the first virus ever discovered. Animal Viruses Viruses that infect animal cells are common causes of disease. No virus is a greater human health threat than the influenza (flu) virus. Like many animal viruses, this one has an outer envelope made of phospholipid membrane, with projecting spikes of protein. The envelope enables the virus to enter and leave a host cell. HIV, the AIDS Virus Retroviruses are so named because they reverse the usual DNA $\rightarrow$ RNA flow of genetic information. These viruses carry molecules of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which catalyzes reverse transcription: The synthesis of DNA on an RNA template. Viroids and Prions Viruses may be small and simple, but they are giants compared to two other classes of pathogens: viroids and prions. Viroids are small, circular RNA molecules that infect plants. Prions are thought to be a misfolded form of a protein normally present in brain cells. How Genes Are Controlled(?)Genes are RegulatedGene expression is controlled by determining whether they gene can be translated into proteins. Gene Regulation in BacteriaShort stretches of DNA that control the genes are called operons. DNA TechnologyAnimal Structure and FunctionUnifying Concepts of Animal Structure and FunctionTHE STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF ANIMALS Individual cells are grouped into tissues Tissues combine to form organs Organs are organized into organ systems Organ systems make up the entire organism “Form Fits Function” Analyzing a biological structure usually will give us clues about What it does ? How it works ? Anatomy versus Physiology: Anatomy is the study of the structure of an organism’s parts. Physiology is the study of the function of those parts. Tissues The cell is the basic unit of all living organisms. In almost all animals, including humans, cells are grouped into tissues. A tissue is an integrated group of similar cells that jointly perform a specific function. Animals have 4 main categories of tissue: Epithelial Tissue, Connective Tissue, Muscle Tissue, and Nervous Tissue. Epithelial Tissue Epithelial tissue, also known as epithelium covers the surface of the body lines organs and cavities within the body Cells of epithelial tissues are tightly linked together form a protective barrier continuously renewed Connective Tissue Connective tissues have a sparse population of cells in an extracellular matrix consisting of a web of protein fibers within a uniform foundation that may be liquid, jellylike, or solid. The structure of connective tissue is correlated with its functions: to bind (connect) to support other tissues Blood is a connective tissue contains red and white blood cells suspended in a liquid called plasma Muscle Tissue Muscle tissue is the most abundant tissue in most animals consists of bundles of long, thin, cylindrical cells called muscle fibers has specialized proteins arranged into a structure that contracts when stimulated by a signal from a nerve. Nervous Tissue Nervous tissue makes communication of sensory information possible is found in your brain and spinal cord consists of a network of neurons. The basic unit of nervous tissue is the neuron, or nerve cell. Organs and Organ Systems An organ consists of two or more tissues packaged into one working unit that performs a specific function. Examples include the heart, liver, stomach, brain, and small intestines. Organ systems are teams of organs that work together and perform vital body functions. Systems: Skeletal System: Supports body and anchors muscles Circulatory System: Transports substances throughout body Respiratory System: exchanges $O_2$ and $CO_2$ between blood and air Muscular System: Moves the body Digestive System: Breaks down food and absorbs nutrients Urinary System: Rids body of certain wastes Endocrine System: Secretes hormones Reproductive system: Produces gametes and offspring Integumentary System: Protects body Lymphatic and Immune System: Defends against disease Nervous System: Processes sensory information and controls responses Exchanges with the External Environment Animals use three organ systems to exchange materials with the external environment: Digestive Respiratory Urinary The circulatory system connects to nearly every organ system transports needed materials from the environment to the body’s tissues carries waste away. Homeostasis(?) Homeostasis is the body’s ability to stay relatively unchanged even when the world around it changes. Interstitial fluid is a liquid that fills the spaces between cells exchanges nutrients and wastes with microscopic blood vessels (capillaries). Negative and Positive Feedback Most mechanisms of homeostasis depend on a principle called negative feedback, in which the results of a process inhibit that same process Less common is positive feedback in which the results of a process intensify that same process such as uterine contractions during childbirth. ThermoregulationThermoregulation is the maintenance of internal body temperature. Endotherms such as mammals and birds derive the majority of their body heat from their metabolism Ectotherms such as most invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, and nonbird reptiles obtain body heat primarily by absorbing it from their surroundings. Fever is an abnormally high internal body temperature usually indicates an ongoing fight against infection Adaptations for Thermoregulation Animals regulate their body temperatures using adaptations that are anatomical physiological, and/or behavioral Physiological Adaptations: panting, shivering, sweating Behaviorial Adaptations: bathing, basking, hibernating, migrating Anatomical Adaptations: hair, fat, feathers Evolution Connection: Adaptations for Thermoregulation A major anatomical adaptation in mammals and birds is insulation, consisting of hair (fur), feathers, or fat layers. Some adaptations are physiological, such as changes in metabolic rate, shivering, panting and sweating. Osmoregulation Living cells depend on a precise balance of water solutes (dissolved substances). Osmoregulation is the control of the gain or loss of Water dissolved solutes, such as the ions (e.g., NaCl, other salts). Osmoconformers have internal and external environments with similar solute concentrations include most marine invertebrates Osmoregulators actively regulate their water loss or gain include freshwater animals, most marine vertebrates, and all land animals Homeostasis in the Urinary System The human urinary system plays a central role in homeostasis forms and excretes waste-carrying urine regulates the amount of water and solutes in body fluids In humans, the two kidneys are the main processing centers contain many fine tubes called tubules and an intricate network of capillaries As blood circulates through the kidneys a fraction of it is filtered the filtrate enters the kidney tubules Filtrate contains valuable substances that need to be reclaimed (such as water and glucose) substances to be eliminated, such as urea. The human urinary system includes the circulatory system the kidneys nephrons, the functional units within the kidneys the urinary bladder, where urine is stored Nephrons consist of a tubule and its associated blood vessels more than a million in a kidney. Nephrons perform four key functions. Filtration, forcing water and other small molecules from the blood to form filtrate Reabsorption of water and valuable solutes back into the blood Secretion of certain substances, such as ions and drugs, into the filtrate Excretion of urine from the kidneys to the outside Kidney failure can be caused by injury illness prolonged use of pain relievers (including over-the-counter medicines such as aspirin), alcohol, or other drugs. One option for treatment of kidney failure is dialysis, filtration of blood by a machine that mimics the action of a nephron. Nutrition and Digestion(?)The “Secret” to Shedding Pounds Obesity is estimated to contribute to 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. The United Nations World Health Organization (UN-WHO) recognizes obesity as a major global health problem. Animal Diets Herbivores mainly feed on plants or algae. Carnivores mainly eat other animals. Omnivores regularly eat both animals and plants or algae. The Four Stages of Food Processing Ingestion is another word for eating. Digestion is the breakdown of food into molecules small enough for the body to absorb. Absorption is the uptake of the small nutrient molecules by cells lining the digestive tract. Elimination is the disposal of undigested food materials. Digestion The dismantling of food molecules is necessary because food molecules are too large to cross the membranes of animal cells different from molecules that make up an animal’s body Classification Mechanical digestion involves physical processes like chewing Chemical digestion is the chemical breakdown (hydrolysis) of food components by digestive enzymes. Digestive Compartments As a cell engulfs food by phagocytosis a food vacuole forms, which then fuses with a lysosome filled with digestive enzymes as food is digested, small food molecules pass through the vacuole membrane into the cytoplasm, which nourishes the cell. Human Digestive System The human digestive system consists of a digestive tube, the alimentary canal (or gut) accessory organs that secrete digestive enzymes. Mouth The mouth, or oral cavity, functions in ingestion the preliminary steps of digestion. Chemical digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva from salivary glands. The muscular tongue tastes shapes food into a ball pushes the food to the back of the mouth for swallowing Circulation and RespirationAnimal Circulation Every organism must exchange materials with its environment, relying on diffusion, the spontaneous movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration a circulatory system, which facilitates the exchange of materials for all but the simplest animals. Circulatory SystemThe Body’s DefensesHormonesReproduction and DevelopmentNervous, Sensory, and Locomotor SystemsOrganization of the Nervous System The nervous system of most animals has two main divisions. The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain and spinal cord (in vertebrates). The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of mostly nerves that carry signals into and out of the CNS. The three interconnected functions of the nervous system are carried out by three types of neurons. Sensory neurons function in sensory input, sending signals from sensory receptors to the CNS. Interneuronsintegrate sensory signals and formulate appropriate responses. Motor neurons function in motor output, the process of sending signals from integration centers to effector cells.

A table can have at most one primary key DEFAULT specify the default value of a column CHECK Used to enforce some constraints in the database Example for CHECK: CHECK A &gt; 0, means that you can’t add negative INTEGER to the column A Functions SUM COUNT MIN MAX AVG Example: SELECT SUM(*) FROM xxx/SELECT COUNT(*) FROM xxxThe database will return a column which column name is the function name. SQLAlchemyExample code for using SQLAlchemy 12345from sqlalchemy import create_enginefrom sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmakerengine = create_engine(&quot;database address&quot;)db = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=engine)) After that, use db.execute to retrieve data. SQLAlchemy can insert the arguments safely.You should use the following way to weite the code. 1db.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO xxx VALUES (:a, :b, :c)&quot;, &#123;&quot;a&quot;: a, &quot;b&quot;: b, &quot;c&quot;: c&#125;) ORMsORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. ORMs let you treat rows and tables inside of a database the same way you would treat an object and classes in an object oriented programming language. With ORM, you can use a class to reference a table. “flask_sqlalchemy” is a library that enables you to use sqlalchemy in flask application. 12345678910from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemydb = SQLAlchemy()class Flight(db.Model): __tablename__ = &quot;flight&quot; (your table name) id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) (each represents a column) origin = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False) destination = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False) duration = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False) The route file: 1234567891011121314151617app = Flask(__name__)app.config[&quot;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&quot;] = &quot;your database url&quot;app.config[&quot;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&quot;] = Falsedb.init_app(app)def main(): f = open(&quot;flights.csv&quot;) reader = csv.reader(f) for origin, destination, duration in reader: flight = Flight(origin=origin, destination=destination, duration=duration) db.session.add(flight) print(f&quot;Added flight from &#123;origin&#125; to &#123;destination&#125; lasting &#123;duration&#125; minutes.&quot;) db.session.commit()if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with app.app_context(): main() Commands in SQLAlchemy: commands usage db.create_all() create table flight=Flight(origin=&#39;xxx&#39;, destination=&#39;xxx)db.session.add(flight) insert data Flight.query.all() SELECT * FROM flights Flight.query.filter_by(origin=&quot;Paris&quot;).all() SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = &#39;Paris&#39; Flight.query.filter_by(origin=&quot;Paris&quot;).count() SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights WHERE origin = &#39;Paris&#39; Flight.query.filter_by(id=28).first()Flight.query.get(28) SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id = 28 flight = Flight.query.get(6)flight.duration = 280 UPDATE flights SET duration = 280 WHERE id = 6 flight = Flight.query.get(28)db.session.delete(flight) DELETE FROM flights WHERE id = 28 db.session.commit() COMMIT Flight.query.order_by(Flight.origin).all() SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY origin Flight.query.order_by(Flight.origin.desc()).all() SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY origin DESC Flight.query.filter(Flight.origin != &quot;Paris&quot;).all() SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin != &#39;Paris&#39; Flight.query.filter(Flight.origin.like(&quot;%a%&quot;)).all() SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin LIKE &#39;%a%&#39; Flight.query.filter(Flight.origin.in_([&quot;Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot;])).all() SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin IN (&#39;Tokyo&#39;, &#39;Paris&#39;) Flight.query.filter(and_(Flight.origin == &quot;Paris&quot;, Flight.duration &gt; 500)).all() SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = &#39;Paris&#39; AND duration &gt; 500 Flight.query.filter(or_(Flight.origin == &quot;Paris&quot;, Flight.duration &gt; 500)).all() SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = &#39;Paris&#39; OR duration &gt; 500 db.session.query(Flight, Passenger).filter(Flight.id == Passenger.flight_id).all() SELECT * FROM flights JOIN passengers ON flights.id = passengers.fought_id APIsHTTP Methods GET: retrieve resource POST: create a new resource PUT: replace a resource PATCH: update a resource DELETE: delete a resource Status Codes 200 OK 201 Created 400 Bad Request 403 Forbidden 404 Not Found 405 Method Not Allowed 422 Unprocessable Entity]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[SecurityGitOpen souce has a trade-off, on one hand, everyone can see the source code so that everyone can help fix the bugs, on the other hand, everyone can look for potential vulnerabilities and then take advantage of it. Also, your git commit history is going to store the entire history, so if you make a commit that accidentally include your credentials. If you delete them in the later commit, the credentials are still there. That’s the potential risk. Be careful about that. FlaskSo when you are building your web application, you can save your key in the Environment Variable. In flask, you can set your secret key like this: app.config[&quot;SEVRET_KEY&quot;] = os.environ_get(&quot;SECRET_KEY&quot;) The way to add environment variable is:export SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxx (for Mac)set SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxx (for Windows) SQLStore PasswordsDon’t directly store the password in the database. Instead of directly store the password in the data base, you should store the hash version of password in the database. SQL InjectionWherever you are making SQL queries, either use a library or do the escape yourself to prevent you from SQL injection attack. JavaScriptCross-Site Scripting: Attackers will inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. e.g. In Flask If your code is like this: 123@app.route(&apos;/&lt;string:name&gt;&apos;)def hello(name): return &quot;Hello,&quot;+name When a viewer typed in /&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;hi&#39;)&lt;/script&gt; An alert ‘hi’ will be raised. This can also happens when you have a form for a user to submit. Solution:For url inject, check “&lt;” and “&gt;” whenever you receive a request. For form submit, add CSRF token. CSRF token is a secret, user-specific token in all form submissions. ScalabilityBenchmarkingA test to see how many user can a server support. Solotions: Vertical Scaling: Get a bigger server Horizontal Scaling: Get more server Problems for Horizontal Scaling How does the server communicate with each other? Which server does the user go to when the come to the website? Solution: add a load balancer Load BalancingMethods to assign connections: Random Choice Round Robin Fewest Connections Session-Aware Load BalancingUser may store some information on the server, what happen when he goes to another server next time? So you need to store the session information. There are three ways to store them. Sticky Sessions (User always go to the same place) Sessions in Database Client-Side Sessions AutoscalingDynamically add servers to the Load Balancer. Use some sort of ping or heartbeat to make sure when a server is down, the load balancer knows. Scaling Databases But there’s another problem raised, a single database can only communicate with a limit number of connections. We use Database Replication to solve this problem Database ReplicationSingle-Primary Replication In single-primary replication, you can read from a number of database but can only read from one database. The you update other database from the writable database. This only solve the read problem but does not solve the write problem. Multi-Primary Replication Multi-Primary Replication solve the problem of read and write at the same time, but raise another problem: what if there’s conflicts? There can be a Git like system to solve this. CachingIf we can store the data in some other place, we may not need to access the data base so often. Client-Side CachingCache-ControlInside the HTTP headers, there’s a header called “Cache-Control”, where you can set the time of the data cache in the computer. Cache-Control: max-age=86400 means that if the user refresh the page less than 86400s after the first request, the browser will not make a request and use the cache data. ETagETag is a tag that is unique for each version of a big file on the server. When a big file is sent to the client, the ETag will be attached. When a browser make a request with the ETag, the web applictaion will not send it again if it is the latest version of that file. Server-Side Caching When there’s request to the database, the web applictaion will save a copy of it and the request inside of Cache, so the server can get the data more quickly in the cache and make less requests to the database.]]></content>

Each component need something to determine what should show up on the page, so each component needs a render function. 12345class Hello extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;; &#125;&#125; So now all Hello class does is display a p tag. Example112345678910111213&lt;div id=&quot;codeexample1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/babel&quot;&gt; class Hello extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;p&gt; This is render by React! &lt;/p&gt; ); &#125; &#125; ReactDOM.render(&lt;Hello /&gt;, document.querySelector(&quot;#codeexample1&quot;));&lt;/script&gt; class Hello extends React.Component { render() { return ( This is render by React! ); } } ReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector("#codeexample1")); Example2123456789101112131415161718192021222324&lt;div id=&quot;codeexample2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/babel&quot;&gt; class Hello extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;p&gt; This is render by React! &lt;/p&gt; ); &#125; &#125; class App extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;Hello/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Above and below are two Hello class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;Hello/&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ) &#125; &#125; ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.querySelector(&quot;#codeexample2&quot;));&lt;/script&gt; class Hello extends React.Component { render() { return ( This is render by React! ); } } class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( Above and below are two Hello class. ) } } ReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector("#codeexample2")); PropertiesSome arguments that attached to a class. Example3123456789101112131415161718192021222324&lt;div id=&quot;codeexample3&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/babel&quot;&gt; class Hello extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;p&gt; This is &#123;this.props.count&#125; &#123;this.props.name&#125; &lt;/p&gt; ); &#125; &#125; class App extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;Hello count=&quot;Number1&quot; name=&quot;Hello Class&quot;/&gt; &lt;Hello count=&quot;Number2&quot; name=&quot;Hello Class&quot;/&gt; &lt;Hello count=&quot;Number3&quot; name=&quot;Hello Class&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ) &#125; &#125; ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.querySelector(&quot;#codeexample3&quot;));&lt;/script&gt; class Hello extends React.Component { render() { return ( This is {this.props.count} {this.props.name} ); } } class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( ) } } ReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector("#codeexample3")); Set the default value: Change This is {this.props.name} to This is {this.props.name || &quot;Hello Class&quot;} So now you can use the Hello class without “name”: &lt;Hello count=&quot;Number3&quot;/&gt; StateIn React, if you change the state of the application, the view of the application is going to change based on that.So if you want to update the page, just change the state of the application, no need to refresh the whole page. Construction FunctionConstruction function is a function Similar to the function __init__ in python.In React, construction function is constructor(props) e.g. 12345class Counter extends React.Component &#123; constructor(props) &#123; super(props); &#125;&#125; Because we are extending the React.Component, and our React codes for our components to work need to use these props, we need to add a line of code super(props); Example4A counter class. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142&lt;div id=&quot;codeexample4&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/babel&quot;&gt; class Counter extends React.Component &#123; constructor(props) &#123; super(props); this.state = &#123; count: 0 &#125; &#125; render() &#123; return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#123;this.state.count&#125;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;button onClick=&#123;this.increment&#125;&gt;+&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button onClick=&#123;this.dncrement&#125;&gt;-&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); &#125; increment = () =&gt; &#123; this.setState(oldState =&gt; (&#123; count: oldState.count+1 &#125;)); &#125; dncrement = () =&gt; &#123; this.setState(oldState =&gt; (&#123; count: oldState.count-1 &#125;)); &#125; &#125; class App extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;Counter /&gt; &lt;Counter /&gt; &lt;Counter /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ) &#125; &#125; ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.querySelector(&quot;#codeexample4&quot;));&lt;/script&gt; class Counter extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { count: 0 } } render() { return ( {this.state.count} + - ); } increment = () => { this.setState(oldState => ({ count: oldState.count+1 })); } dncrement = () => { this.setState(oldState => ({ count: oldState.count-1 })); } } class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( ) } } ReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector("#codeexample4")); NOTE: In React, you are not allow to modify the state directly, you need to use the setState function to change the state. oldState: It is considered a poor design to reference this.state inside of the setState function. Because this may cause a race condition where you run two setState function at a similar time.In practice, you should use a function to take in the state first, then change it based on your new function.This function often called oldState So now when you render many Counter components, you can have many counters and each counter has its own state. Ternary Operator: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse Some Useful JS ToolsList OperationCopy of a List12const list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];const list2 = [...list1]; Copy Then Add12const list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];const list2 = [...list1, 6]; Delete From List1234const list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];list1.splice(3, 1);// Starting from index 3, pull out 1 argument.// list1 is now [1, 2, 3, 5] NodeWhen you actually deploy your website, you would not want the browser to translate your JSX code everytime when someone open the webpage.You need something to translate the JSX code to JS code before deploy for you. An app “create-react-app” is recommended. To install the “create-react-app”, you need Node.js. After you install the “create-react-app”, you can create a new React application just by type in create-react-app Name-of-the-app in the CLI. After you modify your code in the “src” directory, run npm run build, the program will build your application for you. Include translate JSX to JS.]]></content>

HTML file is loaded from top to bottom. Be careful because the location of your JS code may cause bugs in your webpage. Call the JavaScript CodeCall in the HTML1&lt;button event_name=&quot;function_name&quot;&gt;xxx&lt;/button&gt; Call in the JS fileUse querySelector. DOM(Document Object Model) ManipulationquerySelectorSelect the first element in the document. document.querySelector(&#39;tag&#39;) document.querySelector(&#39;#id&#39;) document.querySelector(&#39;.class&#39;) querySelector returns an object. object.innerHTML is the content of the element. So object.innerHTML = xxx can change the content of the element to xxx. You can also modify the style by object.style.xxx NOTE: If you want to select every element in the document, use querySelectorAll, it will return an array of object. addEventListenerdocument.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function) the function you passed in will be executed after all the DOM content loaded. Used to fix the problem that JS code loaded at the front of the HTML document. Arrow Functionsx =&gt; x*2 Takes the left of the arrow and output the right of the arrow.

All contents under all blueprint/original template folder will be treated as if they are in a same big folder “template”. If there are templates of the same name, Flask will search the original template folder first and then the blueprint folders. The solution is to create a folder with the same name in the blueprint’s template folder, so you can use it like your static folder.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[IntroductionThis article is about two special property of Daterangeslider in bokeh, which can help develop your bokeh app.My bokeh version is 1.3.1.Body According to the official documentation, Bokeh Daterangeslider has two property method: value_as_date and value_as_datetime. Normally, when you called the on_change callback function, bokeh will return you a tuple of Unix timestamp in miliseconds. It’s very inconvinient to change the format of the datetime. So you can call daterangeslider.value_as_date or daterangeslider.value_as_datetime (remember this is property not method) in your callback function. Both will return you a tuple of datetime.date object, which can be conveniently turned into any format of datetime via its own strftime method. Yet anothor way of using property method doesn’t work. You can’t simply pass in value_as_date or value_as_datetime in the on_change method. e.g. daterangeslider.on_change(&quot;value_as_date&quot;, on_change) This will raise an error]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F10%2Farticle%2Fpython%2Fembed%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This article is based on the official document of Bokeh and is about embed bokeh application in flask using app sessions.What you need to do is to pull a session from a bokeh server, turn it into script and insert it into your template. So you need to set up a bokeh server first. bokeh serve --show &quot;your bokeh file address&quot; Keep it open. Due to Bokeh’s safety settings, you need to set allow web-socket origin to avoid errors when you are setting up your bokeh server. 123bokeh serve --show &quot;your bokeh file address&quot;--allow-websocket-origin=localhost:5006 (This is bokeh server&apos;s default port, if you reset the port, change it to the port you set)--allow-websocket-origin=&quot;your web page address that you want to embed your bokeh app&quot; Then you need to complete your route function: 1234def bkapp_page(): with pull_session(url=&quot;http://localhost:5006/&#123;your bokeh file name&#125;&quot;) as session: script = server_session(session_id=session.id, url=&apos;http://localhost:5006/&#123;your bokeh file name&#125;&apos;) (As the above, change the port if you reset it yourself) return render_template(&quot;your template&quot;, script=script, template=&quot;Flask&quot;) Don’t forget to import the functions you need 12from bokeh.client import pull_sessionfrom bokeh.embed import server_session Finally, put the script into your template. In the body part of the template: Put in: {{script|indent(n)|safe}} “{{}}“ is the jinja representation of codescript is the script that you put in the render_template functionindent(n) means the number of spaces of where you put your script (Just for beautify your code)safe means that Jinja won’t take care of some illegal symbol for you(like “&lt;&gt;”, which normally will be turned into “&lt;” and “&gt;”) So now you complete embed your bokeh app in your flask app. Run your app.py for a test!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This article is about my way to deploy my own flask app on cloud.I use the service provided by Tencent Cloud, which uses CentOS 7.2 as the operating system of the CVM.I use gunicorn to deploy the my flask app and use nginx to do reverse proxy. 1234Install python3 and set symbolic linksCreate virtual environmentInstall and configure NginxInstall and configure gunicorn Install Python3CentOS 7.2 uses python 2.7.5 to support the “yum” command. So what we have to do is: 123Install Python3Set default python version to 3Set default python version of yum to 2 Preinstall Packages123456789yum install gcc gcc-c++ # C compiler that used to compile pythonyum install make # C make libraryyum install -y openssl openssl-devel openssl-static # SSL support packageyum install bzip2-devel # decompression support packageyum install expat-devel # XML document resolve packageyum install gdbm-devel # gdbm database libraryyum install readline-devel # Auto complete support packageyum install sqlite-devel # sqlite support packageyum groupinstall -y &quot;Development tools&quot; # install development tools InstallI choose python version 3.6.4 because it is stable.Download 1wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tgz Decompress 1tar -zxvf Python-3.6.4.tgz Change directory 1cd Python-3.6.4 Configure and Install 12./configure prefix=/usr/local/python3make &amp;&amp; make install Create symbolic links for python and pip12ln -s /usr/local/python3/bin/python3 /usr/bin/pythonln -s /usr/local/python3/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip -s: for symbolic links/usr/local/python3/bin/python3: source directory/usr/bin/python: target directory So now when you type python, you’ll call python3, and python2 for python2. You can call python -V and python2 -V to check that. Because yum still needs python2, we need to change yum’s configuration file. Type ls -ol yum* to find the configuration file. Do the following change to all the file listed: #!/usr/bin/python –&gt; #!/usr/bin/python2 You may use vi editor vi yum (vi+directory) to edit them. Virtual EnvironmentWhen using two different version of the same package, virtual environment can prevent you from keeping installing can uninstalling the packages. Install virtualenvpip install virtualenv to install Create virtual environment1/usr/local/python3/bin/virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv /usr/local/python3/bin/virtualenv: the directory of the virtualenv package/usr/bin/python3: the base of your virtual environmentvenv: the name of the virtual environment This command will create a virtual environment under the current directory. source venv/bin/activate activate the virtual environment, venv is the name of your virtual environment deactivate exit the current virtual environment Install Python Packagesuse pip install xxx, xxx is the package you want to install pip install -r requirement.txt when you have all your requirement in the requirement.txt file To generate requirement.txt, pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt in your own computer gunicornInstallWhen the virtual environment is activate, run pip install gunicorn Start the service1gunicorn -w 4 [-D] -b 127.0.0.1:8000 wsgi:application -w: the number of progress you want gunicorn to start-D: start the service background-b: bind your service to the certain IP, you should put tour LAN IP with the port you want to specify here.wsgi: the manage filename of your flask appapplication: the variable name in your flask app NginxInstall Nginx1yum install nginx After installation, use rpm -ql nginx to check the installation directory. commands of Nginx 1234567service nginx startservice nginx stopservice nginx restartservice nginx reload # reload the service after changing the configuration file Now you can see the Nginx welcome page when you type in your WAN IP in your own brower.

    <title><![CDATA[Python Crawler that Deal with ajax]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F06%2Farticle%2Fpython%2Fajax%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Have you met this problem? When you are going to crawl down some data from a website, you find nothing in the source code? When searching on the search engines, you may encounter the word “ajax”. According to Wikipedia, ajax is a web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. It means that the web page can load the data without refresh the whole page. I will walk through the path that I crawl ajax data. Hope this can inspire you when designing your own program. Follow the Common WayMy goal is to crawl down the op.gg “Game Stat by Champion” page’s data. Check the Source CodeFirst, open Chrome, press ctrl+U to callout the source code. We try to search the first champions’ name “Sivir”. There is no “Sivir” in the source code. That means the website used some technique to load the data after the page is loaded. It’s now to take out our most powerful tool – Chrome DevTools Use Chrome DevToolsChrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built in the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help us analyse the website’s structure. NetworkWe notice that there’s some query buttons above the chart. The network page enables us to monitor all the queries and links that is activate after we turn the DevTools on. So we callout the network page and click those query buttons. We get this: https://www.op.gg/statistics/ajax2/champion/ We clicked it, found data in it. But our job is not done yet. No matter what button we clicked, we always get the same url, the same data. It seems that we missed some query values. It’s time for elements. ElementsIn the elements, find where the buttons are. We can easily find that there’s several “Cell” td class and “ButtonWrap” div class in each “Cell” class. Look inside the “RadioButton” class, we can find the query values. “name” is the query name, in this case it is “period”, and “value” is the query value, in this case it is “week”. So we can get an url https://www.op.gg/statistics/ajax2/champion/period=week and it works. Look through all “Cell” class and then we can get all the query names and query values. Then we can get all the data. ConclusionThe way to get data from ajax loading page is:123Search the source code.Activate query and monitor connection using NetworkInspect Elements to get query names and values]]></content>
